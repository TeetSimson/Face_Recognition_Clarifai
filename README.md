# Face_Recognition_Clarifai

My first MENG full stack web application!

This web application lets you paste a jpg image link into
the input box and scan it to detect all the faces in that
image after which a blue rectangle is displayed around 
each face. Every registered user has a entry count stored 
in the database how many image links has he/she scanned.

Used libraries and API-s: bcryptjs, Clarifai, nodemon,
particlesjs, react-tilt, tachyons, expressjs, knex, 
cors, pg and regular expression.

Deployed everything, React front-end, NodeJS back-end and 
PostgreSQL to Heroku for free. 

This project was part of the Zero to mastery course!
